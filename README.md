sudo python3 register_new_matrix_user.py -c /etc/matrix-synapse/homeserver.yaml https://matrix.timothyaveni.com:8448

(I got this python script directly from the synapse repo)

now log into the acct with element in an incognito window

app.element.io

homeserver timothyaveni.com

while you're logged in, join the room you want to send messages to

settings -> help and about -> advanced -> access token. copy that.

don't log out, just close the incognito window

maybe it will give you a security key? ig you can keep that? idrc idt
